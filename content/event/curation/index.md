summary: Presenter 
abstract: In this presentation, Dr Neha Gupta presents insights from the FAIR+CARE Cultural Heritage Network, a group working to investigate, develop, demonstrate, and promote more equitable cultural heritage data curation practices. The Network aims to reconcile the apparent social and technical contradictions between two highly regarded data management principles - CARE (collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics) and FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse). She brings these insights into the Canadian context to open conversation on how First Nations can use Indigenous Data Governance principles in archaeology, and how individuals and institutions can implement the FAIR and CARE Principles in their workplaces.
