Congratulations to Dr Neha Gupta on her contribution to the recently launched Community Research Data Toolkit, edited by Danica Evering and Subhanya Sivajothy and published by the McMaster University Libraries. 

<!--more-->

In this Toolkit, Neha Gupta contributed to the conceptualization and writing on the section on  Responsibilities and Resources in Research Partnerships, specifically on "Ground Rules: Start Out by Building Relationships". The chapter includes a downloadable template that communities can use to learn about the research process and make informed decisions about their participation in projects when approached by researchers.
