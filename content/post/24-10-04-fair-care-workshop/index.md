Dr Neha Gupta, one of four directors on the FAIR+CARE cultural heritage network, participated in the first in-person workshop held in California, US. She leads a working group that focuses on the implementation of FAIR+CARE practices in the heritage sector, and in the development of an assessment tool and resources that Tribes, institutions and researchers can use in their everyday practice.

[Advancing FAIR+CARE Practices in Cultural Heritage] (https://alexandriaarchive.org/fair-care/) is funded through the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grants for Libraries program. Outcomes of this project include the establishment of a diverse network of individuals and institutions to promote FAIR+CARE practices, as well as training materials, a self-assessment tool, and an open-source reference implementation to demonstrate and facilitate adoption. Through public presentations, research papers, articles in professional newsletters, and a public website, the network will disseminate ways to improve the overall quantity and quality of reusable cultural heritage data while reducing risks of harm. This project will also catalyze more lasting and sustained improvement in data curation practices. By incubating a longer-term coalition across key institutions, future partnerships will oversee updates to these models and tools as needs evolve.
