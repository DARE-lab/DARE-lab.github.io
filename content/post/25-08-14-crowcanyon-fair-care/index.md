In this webinar, the four directors, Desiree Martinez, Sarah Kansa, Christopher Nicholson and Neha Gupta presented on Advancing Practices to Support Ethical Data Management with the FAIR+CARE Cultural Heritage Network. The directors talked about current practices in American archaeology, including key issues with Open Science, and how the FAIR and CARE principles are encouraging archaeologists to address harms in the data ecosystem. Crucially, implementing the FAIR and CARE principles can enable a data lifecycle that center Indigenous coummunities and ensure they are active decision-makers throughout the data lifecycle.
