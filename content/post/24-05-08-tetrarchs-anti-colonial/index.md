Congratulations to Dr Neha Gupta on her talk in the Transforming Data Reuse in Archaeology (TETRARCHs) seminar series in May 2024.

In this talk, Dr Gupta presented research with Westbank First Nation archaeologists that enacts Indigenous Data Governance principles in archaeology and digital heritage, and preliminary research to build on the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interopable, Reuseable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) data governance principles for cultural heritage in American archaeology. She discussed how contextualizing data practice can help build an anti-colonial digital archaeology.

TETRARCHs is funded through the Transformations: Social and cultural dynamics in the digital age programme of the Collaboration of Humanities and Social Sciences in Europe (CHANSE) Consortium, and aims to demonstrate that data optimised for ethical and emotive storytelling will provide the bridge between those who find or preserve heritage assets, and the diverse cross-European audiences for whom they might generate meaning. In archaeology, much work has been done to make data Findable, Accessible and Interoperable (according to the FAIR Principles), but little is understood about whether data are Reusableâ€“and by whom.
